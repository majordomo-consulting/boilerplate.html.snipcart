This is an example e-commerce site written in HTML with CSS and Snipcart.  Though there are better alternatives for developers, the simplicity of this package may be preferred by some.

## To customize this package:

### Files to Edit

1) css/default.css - font and colour values
2) /img - places your images here
3) /products/index.html - the "shop" page with Snipcart integration
4) blank.html - a blank template page
5) index.html - the homepage
6) landing-2.html - full screen image example homepage
7) privacy.html - privacy policy blank page

### Snipcart Setup

To use this template you will need to create a Snipcart account (free).  You do not need to enter your credit card details if only accepting in-person payments.

1) Complete steps 1 & 2 in the Snipcart dashboard (Fill in your business information, configure your domains)
2) Configure the payment gateway (Deferred Payments) by clicking on the account profile icon on the top right
3) At the bottom of the page, turn Deferred Payments to ON, then click 'CONFIGURE' - choose - 'Only allow deferred payments'
4) Click on TAXES in the menu and CREATE NEW TAX - enter your details (e.g HST, CA, ON, 0.13)
5) Click on Domains & URLs - the domain you put here MUST MATCH the location of the products folder - if it doesn't, YOUR CART WILL NOT WORK
6) Go to API KEYS - COPY your PUBLIC TEST API KEY (yes the test key is all you will ever need if accepting in-person payments).  Look at the index file /products/index.html - at the bottom of the page, paste your API key.
